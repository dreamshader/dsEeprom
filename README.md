The idea for the dsEeprom-Library was to make my life easier. I did always the same job in several small projects on ESP-modules or for an Arduino: read/write EEPROM content.
To simplify this, I created this library. Because it is designed for my needs, it may or my not be useful for you.

General:
To install the library, you may download the zip-file or clone the repository.
